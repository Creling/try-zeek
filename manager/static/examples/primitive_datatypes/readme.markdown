Primitive Datatypes
===================

Now that we have variables we can talk about which data types we can use and assign to variables.
In this chapter we will introduce the simpler types.

Bro has a static type system (the type of data a variable holds is
fixed) with type inference, e.g., ``local x = 0`` is equivalent to
``local x: count = 0`` and implicit type promotion/coercion - limited
to numeric types or records with optional/default fields.

* ``bool`` - a value that's either true (``T``) or false (``F``).
* ``double`` - a double-precision floating-point value.
* ``int`` - a signed 64-bit integer.  May be automatically promoted to
  a ``double`` when needed.
* ``count`` - an unsigned 64-bit integer.  May be automatically promoted
  to an ``int`` or ``double`` when needed.

* ``time`` - an absolute point in time (note the only way to create an
  arbitrary time value is via the ``double_to_time(d)``, with ``d``
  being a variable of type ``double``).
* ``interval`` - a relative unit of time. Known units are ``usec``,
  ``msec``, ``sec``, ``min``, ``hr``, or ``day`` (any may be pluralized by
  adding "s" to the end).  Examples: ``3secs``, ``-1min``.

* ``port`` - a transport-level port number.  Examples: ``80/tcp``,
  ``53/udp``.
* ``addr`` - an IP address.  Examples: ``1.2.3.4``, ``[2001:db8::1]``.
* ``subnet`` - a set of IP addresses with a common prefix.  Example:
  ``192.168.0.0/16``.  Note that the ``/`` operator used on an address as
  the left operand produces a subnet mask of bit-width equal to the value
  of the right operand.

* ``enum`` - a user-defined type specifying a set of related values.
      type Color: enum { Red, Green, Blue, };
* ``string`` - character-string values.
* ``pattern`` - a regular expression using [flex's syntax](http://flex.sourceforge.net/manual/Patterns.html).

Run the code in this example. Read the reference on [types](https://www.bro.org/sphinx/script-reference/types.html) 
and try to play with the given code example. Change the types, for example.
