The Switch Statement
=====================

Sometimes a switch statement is a more convenient way to organize code.
For example, consider a switch instead of large chains of "else if"
blocks, or possibly if there's a large chain of OR'd conditions.

The syntax is similar to other common languages, "switch - variable - label".
In this example 
	x = 4.
In Bro it is possible to collect two or more label values to execute the same block of code.
Also you can declare a default case if the input value does not match any of the cases.
