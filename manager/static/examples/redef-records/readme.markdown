Redefinitions for records
============================

`redef` not only works with values, but also
certain *types*.  Namely `record` (and `enum`) may be extended, which is shown in this
code example.

Redefining records is especially helpful when working with given modules. 

Run this code example. Play with the the printing command, change the `redef` and see what effects
happen.
