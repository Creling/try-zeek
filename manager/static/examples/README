Creating and/or changing try-bro content
==========================================

All examples should follow a certain structure.
The order of the examples is given by index files named 'index'.
The toplevel index file contains the top-level topics or chapters, e.g.,
basics. Basics contains all basic Bro functionality, e.g., data types, loops etc.
The list in an index file contains the names of the sub direktories.
Each directory contains at least two files, the readme.markdown with the explanation, and
the main.bro with the example code. The readme files have to be written using the 
markdown syntax.

Within basics some of the examples have sub directories themselves. In that case the sub dir contains another index that lists 
further directories, e.g., 'for' and 'while' in the directory 'loops'.
Please have a look at existing examples before creating new ones.
