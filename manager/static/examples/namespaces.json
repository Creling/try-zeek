For now we only need to know the concept.</p>\n<p>A reference of all scripts that can be loaded is found <a href=\"https://www.bro.org/sphinx/script-reference/scripts.html\">here</a></p>\n<p>The code here shows a simple script that does nothing else but loading a module. The script \n<a href=\"https://www.bro.org/sphinx/scripts/policy/misc/dump-events.bro.html\">misc/dump-events</a> dumps \nthe events that Bro raises out to standard output in a readable form. This is for debugging only \nand allows to understand events and their parameters as Bro processes input. \nNote that it will show only events for which a handler is defined.</p>", "pcaps": ["exercise_traffic.pcap"]}
