Exercise
==========================

Now that we have types, operators, functions, loops and logic control we can 
go into a first exercise.

As you have seen, Zeek supports pattern matching. 
Pattern matching can be a powerful tool especially in the area of network debugging and security.
Finding specific things in logs is an efficient way to make a change in many situations.

*  Write a program to remove every letter "e" from an arbitrary string
   of your choosing (does not have to be done in-place).

*  Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for
   multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number; and for 
   multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of
   both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

The solution to this exercise follows on the next page.
