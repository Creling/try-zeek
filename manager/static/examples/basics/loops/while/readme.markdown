Loops: While
================

A "while" loop iterates over a body statement as long as a given condition remains true.

A [break](https://docs.zeek.org/en/current/script-reference/statements.html#keyword-break) 
statement can be used at any time to immediately terminate 
the "while" loop, and a 
[next](https://docs.zeek.org/en/current/script-reference/statements.html#keyword-next) 
statement can be used to skip to the next loop iteration.
