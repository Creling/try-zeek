Set
===================

A `set` is a collection of unique values.  Sets use the `add` and
`delete` operators to add and remove elements, and the `in`
operator to test for membership. 

Run the example. 

In this example we first define a set of strings, containing the words "one", "two", and "three".
The we add the string "four" to it. Thus the test for membership of "four" will result in "T" for
true. The same way we can delete "two" from the set, testing if "two is not a member will result 
in "T" again. Adding the string "one" has no effect since it is already in the set.
We can also use a for loop to print each member of a set.
