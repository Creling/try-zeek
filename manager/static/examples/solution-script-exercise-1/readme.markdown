Exercise 1: Soluition
=====================================

Here is the solution for the first exercise.

In the bro\_init event we have a simple for-loop that iterates over
the string "testing". Every character is tested if it is an "e", 
and if yes a counter is incremented.

The second example shows recursive usage of a function.
The recursion counts to 100 and replaces every 3rd number by "Fizz", every
fifth by "Buzz". To do this the modulo operation is used.
